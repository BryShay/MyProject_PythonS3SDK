# MyProject_PythonS3SDK
Python Boto3 Project for AWS Developer Class
In This project I created a function in a Python program that will implement a menu that allows the user to:

Create a bucket (prompt for the name) 
List all buckets
Upload a file 
List all files in a particular bucket 
Delete a file 
Delete a bucket
